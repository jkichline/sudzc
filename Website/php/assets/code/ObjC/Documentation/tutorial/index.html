		<h1>Getting Started With SudzC</h1>
		<p>
			SudzC is a tool for generating proxy code from web service definition files (WSDL).  
			While it supports generating code in multiple languages, it's focus it Objective-C. 
			This documentation was generated to help you get started with SudzC immediately.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Using this documentation</h2>
		<p>
			This documentation is design to allow you to reference your newly generated code base.
			To get started, click on a package on the left.  This will reveal the service methods that are available.
			You can then go directly into a class reference by clicking a link on the left-side navigation, 
			or by clicking on inline links on the right.  This lets you traverse the code hierarchy.
		</p>
		<p>To get back to this screen, simply click the "All Packages" link at the top of the navigation, followed by the "Getting Started" link to return here.</p>
		
		<h2>The example project</h2>
		<p>
			In addition to this documentation and the generated code files, a sample project has been created.
			You can open this project and get started right now.  This includes real code samples and fragments to jump in quickly.
			However, you will probably want to add SudzC to your own project.  To do that, follow the directions below.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Adding the source files to your project</h2>
		<p>
			Copy the "Source" folder contained in the archive into your Xcode project tree by dragging it from your Finder, into the tree.
			You may want to add them in their own folder group, or rename it to make managing your project a little easier in the future.
		</p>

		<p>
			Be sure to add the SystemConfiguration framework to your project.
			This enables the web service calls to check network availability on 
			each request in order to abide by the Apple User Interface guidelines.
		</p>

		<p>
			In order to compile the project, you must add a header to the project settings so that TouchXML works correctly.
			To do this, choose "Edit Project Settings" from the "Project" menu in the menubar.  
			Navigate to the "Build" tab and make the following changes, without quotes.
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>In the "Linking" section, go to the "Other Linker Flags" section and add the value "-lxml2".</li>
			<li>In the "Search Paths" section add a new search path to the "Header Search Paths" for "/usr/include/libxml2". This will include the proper C libraries for compiling TouchXML.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>That's it!  You are now ready to compile your project.</p>


		<h2>How to use generated code</h2>
		<p>To make a web service call, you first create an instance of your service class.
		This should be the one named after the class you used to make your web services.  
		For instance, if you are dealing with Widgets, you may have WidgetService.  
		This will translate into an Objective-C class.
		To use it, you must first include it by importing the header file:</p>
		<code>#import "WidgetService.h"</code>
		
		<p>Then in your code, instantiate the class with an alloc/init:</p>
		<code>WidgetService* service = [[WidgetService alloc] init];</code>
		
		<p>You could also use the class method to make this even easier:</p>
		<code>WidgetService* service = [WidgetService service];</code>

		<p>
			Now that class has a whole bunch of methods associated with it.
			Service classes can also be set to use custom URLs, send SOAP headers, etc... but for now, we will keep it simple.
			Let's say you have a method to find widgets called "Find".
			You would call that method like this:
		</p>
		<code>[service Find: self action: @selector(handleFind:) criteria: @"test" maxRecords: 5];</code>

		<p>
			In this case, we call the method with two parameters: criteria and maxRecords.  
			The first parameter right after Find: references the "delegate", 
			or the object that is going to handle the request.  
			The second parameter "action" specifies a method that is going to handle the result.  
			This is the easiest way to implement a call, although there is a way to do it without the "action" method, 
			but I'm not going to confuse you.</p>

		<p>
			To handle the results from the web service, you write a method called "handleFind:"
			This is a method written in the delegate object you specified in the first parameter.  
			So in this case, make the method in the same object making the call, or "self".</p>
		<pre>-(void)handleFind: (id) result {
	if([result isKindOfClass: [NSError class]]) {
		// If an error has occurred, handle it
		return;
	}

	if([result isKindOfClass: [SoapFault class]]) { 
		// If a server error has occurred, handle it
		return;
	}

	// Actually do something with the result...
	self.myDataArray = (NSMutableArray*)result;
}
</pre>

		<p>So in this example, the "handleFind" method handles any response that calling the Find method creates.  
		Each request can return either an error (like could not resolve the domain name for instance), 
		a SoapFault (an error occurred in your code on the server), or the actual result.  
		The results come back as a "typed" class, but are sent using the Objective-C "id" type, 
		which you can kind of think of as a "var" in Javascript.</p>

		<p>
			Another way to handle the response, is to have the class from which you are calling the 
			method implement the SoapDelegate protocol.  You do this in your implementation file.  
			So if you are writing a UITableViewController you would use it like this:</p>

<pre>
@interface MyTableViewController : UITableViewController <SoapDelegate> {
	// Your interface here...
}
</pre>

		<p>
			The SoapDelegate class requires an onload: method, but optionally takes an onerror: and onfault: method.  
			This is similar to the other method, except your request does not include an "action" parameter:</p>
		<code>[service Find: self criteria: @"test" maxRecords: 5];</code>

		<p>
			When the method returns results, it calls "onload:".  
			If it returns an error, it calls "onerror:", and when a SoapFault, "onfault:".  
			You write your method slightly different without all the class type testing because 
			you know you are only going to get an actual result in onload:</p>
<pre>
-(void)onload:(id)result {
	self.myDataArray = result;
}
</pre>

		<p>Another common technique used is to implement the "onload:" method for every call made to the object.  
		Then determine what the result is to determine what to do.  For instance, we might call "Find", 
		which returns an array, and also "Create" which returns a Widget.  So we can do this:</p>
<pre>
-(void)onload:(id)result {
	if([result isKindOfClass: [NSArray class]]) {
		self.myDataArray = result;
	}
	if([result isKindOfClass:[Widget class]]) {
		[self.myDataArray addObject: result];
	}
}
</pre>

		<p>
			Hopefully this gets you started in your development.  
			Please do not forget to right-click on your service class to see the code.  
			SudzC uses the WSDL comments and such to document each method and what it returns.
